# ReducReloaded

From the creaters of Reduc, the masters of being really shitty at game dev bring another 
action filled, bug ridden, class action disaster waiting to happen. 

Get ready for Reduc:RELOADED!

# Purpose of this project
For a long time some friends and I have been trying to plan and create an Android app among
other projects. Every single time the project fails due to lack of commitment or never being 
able to meet up and plan or people just lose interest or any other number of reasons.

I'm tired of that so I proposed the idea that we just code:
    
    We do absolutely zero planning
    We don't tell each other our plans
    We don't tell each other what specific code is for (apart from comments)
    We don't care
    We don't commit to the project
    Anyone can join
    
The whole idea is that maybe eventually the code will either turn into something or
become whole enough that we can at least come up with a plan that we are excited about 
and actually willing to commit too. It's a way to motivate ourselves to actually code.

Feel free to submit a pull request or contact me to be added as a contributor. 

Finally, messing with and/or continuing someones code is totally acceptable (try to be creative.. don't just delete code)








...The worst android app ever can't be the worst if it doesn't have a link to a website that doesn't work.
